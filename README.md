# computer_vision_examples
Collection of Python files that contain example use cases of computer vision primarily using the Open CV library. 

Need to pip install gTTS, pyteseract (this also requires some addition setup on Windows), and opencv. 

Run the VideoCapture example to use camera(1) to take a photo of some text by pushing the 'q' button. This should recognize the text and use text to speech to read back the text.
